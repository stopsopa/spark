What? Why?
-

In order to provide SEO accesability for existing projects (Angular 1) I decided to go for prerender tools.
I didn't want though use prerender.io because it is old.
Project is currently in use with few projects from more then year and it seems to work just fine.
Progressively though I'm replacing all systems with SSR build on top of React/Redux stack.
